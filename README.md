Official implementation of 'Adapting to Inter-Subject Variability in EEG-Based Motor Imagery Classification with Meta-Learning' (ICLR 2023). Our meta-learning approach is compared to transfer learning in terms of accuracy after few-shot fine-tuning on new subjects for EEG-based motor imagery classification.
